â€‹â€‹Top 10 Exchanges with Native Tokens by 24H Trading Volume-to-Market Cap Ratio



Exchanges with lower trading volumes often have more undervalued native tokens compared to well-known crypto exchanges with higher trading volumes. This is evident from our analysis of the top 10 crypto exchanges by liquidity, each with its own native token.



Methodology



We analyzed the top 10 exchanges with their own tokens, ranked by 24H liquidity based on data for February 3, 2025. We then divided the 24H trading volume by the market cap of each exchange's token to identify which tokens are the most undervalued relative to their trading volume.

  "content": "Two-thirds of humanity is under the control of men over 70, with the US, Russia, China, India, and Iran being led by elderly males. Approximately 5.4 billion people, or 67.5% of the global population, are governed by men in this age group. This trend is notable, with many countries seeing a concentration of power in the hands of older male leaders. The implications of this are significant, with potential effects on global policies and decision-making. It's an interesting pattern to observe, and one that may have far-reaching consequences.",

  "content": "Interesting: Abstract's hidden badge system is more extensive than initially thought. There are additional badges available for completing specific tasks, such as connecting an OKX wallet, buying and holding NFT absocks, playing Duper, and obtaining certain roles on Discord. Some badges, like \"Early Bird,\" are reserved for early adopters who joined the waiting list. Others, like the $PENGU holder badge, require holding a certain amount of tokens. Time to get to work and collect those badges.",
